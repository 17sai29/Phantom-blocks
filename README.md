# Phantom-blocks
# I have downloaded the dataset from https://xblock.pro/xblock-eth.html
# The anomaly file is for preprocessing the data which we had downloaded like splitting into daywise csv, removing unneccessary columns, converting to text files, mapping of address, calling functions, iserror columns.
# the files named vulnerability 1-3, are for showing the plots of various features of attacks and  the anomalous days are marked based on threshold which we identified to be a better one
# some part of code in vulnerability is commented ,please uncomment it and run to see visualization.
